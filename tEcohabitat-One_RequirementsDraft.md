# Requirements Specification Document  
**Project:** tEcoHabitat-One 
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the design, development, and implementation of **tEcoHabitat-One**, the first tEcoHabitat— a fully automated, self-sufficient, human-scale habitat designed to provide high-quality living while preserving nature and minimizing ecological impact.  

### 1.2 Scope  
tEcoHabitat-One will integrate advanced technologies in automation, renewable energy, water recycling, food production, and waste management to create a **closed-loop community** of approximately 150 people. The habitat is designed to be **scalable** and **replicable**, eventually forming a network of sustainable communities worldwide.

## 2. System Overview  

- **Population:** 150 residents, max. 200 (based on Dunbar’s number to ensure cohesive community size).  
- **Core Services:** Provision of basic human needs: food, water, shelter, air, health, safety.  
- **Sustainability:** Fully automated, zero waste, renewable energy powered, fully off-grid 
- **Technology Role:** Automation, robotics, and AI to eliminate daily survival burdens.  
- **Community Goal:** Safe, healthy, creative, and resilient human-scale society.

## 3. Functional Requirements  

### 3.1 Social & Community Spaces  
- **Private living units (150 rooms).**  
- **Communal areas:** dining, recreation, learning.  
- **Requirement:** Foster social cohesion while ensuring personal privacy.
- **Open Issues:** See discussions

### 3.2 Energy Systems  
- **Renewable sources preferred:** Solar, wind, biogas.  
- **Energy storage:** Battery systems.  
- **Backup plan:** Secondary eco-friendly energy sources (to be defined).  
- **Requirement:** 24/7 autonomy without damaging the environment.
- **Open Issues:** See discussions

### 3.3 Transportation & Circulation
- **Electric aerial transport:**  
  - Drone or small helicopter for emergency, transport, or delivery purposes  
  - Must run on electricity only, with dedicated charging stations  
  - Integration with habitat’s microgrid for sustainable energy supply
  - **Open Issues:** See discussions

### 3.4 Communication & Connectivity  
- **High-speed internet via satellite dish.**  
- **Requirement:** Constant connectivity for global collaboration.
- **Wi-fi:** Inside the habitat and in the surrounding areas.
- **Open Issues:** See discussions

### 3.5 Automation & Control  
- **Robotic systems**: farming, maintenance, food preparation.  
- **Central AI**: monitors critical systems (food, water, air, health).  
- **Requirement:** All *Maslow’s base needs* must be automated.  
- **Open Issue:** Human oversight vs. AI autonomy balance. 
- **Off scope:** Construction of the first habitat, just maintenance.
- **Open Issues:** See discussions

### 3.6 Water Management  
- **Closed-loop recycling system**.  
- **Greywater treatment** → irrigation and reuse.  
- **Blackwater treatment** → biodigester for energy + fertilizer.  
- **Potable water reservoir** fed by filtration.  
- **Requirement:** 100% independence from outside water sources.
- **Open Issues:** See discussions


### 3.7 Waste Management  
- **Organic waste → biodigester → energy + fertilizer.**  
- **Non-organic waste → Ouside managment**  
- **Requirement:** Zero external waste discharge.
- **Open Issues:** See discussions

### 3.8 Food Production  
- **Vertical Farming Towers** (Vegan only)
- **Greenhouses** for controlled seasonal production.  
- **Horizontal Farming** for crops unsuitable for vertical systems (grains, legumes).  
- **Requirement:** Must ensure **100% vegetarian, diverse, healthy diet**.  
- **Open Issues:** See discussions

### 3.9 Other Architectural Aspects
- **Structure on posts**: wildlife moves freely below.  
- **Minimal land footprint.**   
- **Safety:** Redundant systems for energy, water, air
- **Scalability:** Design must be modular and replicable. 
- **Open Issues:** See discussions

## 4. Conclusion  

tEcoHabitat-One is not just a building — it is a **living system**. This requirements specification sets the foundation, while recognizing that many aspects must be **collaboratively refined** with experts, volunteers, and innovators. The ultimate goal is to design **a blueprint for future living** that protects both humanity and nature.
