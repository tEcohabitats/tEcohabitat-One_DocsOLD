# Requirements Specification Document  
**Project:** tEcoHabitat-One 
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the design, development, and implementation of **tEcoHabitat** — a fully automated, self-sufficient, human-scale habitat designed to provide high-quality living while preserving nature and minimizing ecological impact.  

### 1.2 Scope  
tEcoHabitat will integrate advanced technologies in automation, renewable energy, water recycling, food production, and waste management to create a **closed-loop community** of approximately 150 people. The habitat is designed to be **scalable** and **replicable**, eventually forming a network of sustainable communities worldwide.

## 2. System Overview  

- **Population:** ~150 residents (based on Dunbar’s number to ensure cohesive community size).  
- **Core Services:** Provision of basic human needs: food, water, shelter, air, health, safety.  
- **Sustainability:** Fully automated, zero waste, renewable energy powered.  
- **Technology Role:** Automation, robotics, and AI to eliminate daily survival burdens.  
- **Community Goal:** Safe, healthy, creative, and resilient human-scale society.

## 3. Functional Requirements  

### 3.1 Social & Community Spaces  
- **Private living units (150 rooms).**  
- **Communal areas:** dining, recreation, learning.  
- **Requirement:** Foster social cohesion while ensuring personal privacy.

### 3.2 Energy Systems  
- **Renewable sources preferred:** Solar, wind, biogas.  
- **Energy storage:** Battery systems.  
- **Backup plan:** Secondary eco-friendly energy sources (to be defined).  
- **Requirement:** 24/7 autonomy without fossil fuels.  
- **Open Issue:** Exact energy demand calculations pending full design.

### 3.3 Transportation & Circulation
- **Internal pathways:** Pedestrian-first circulation with separate bicycle lanes  
- **Parking:** Minimal, primarily for community vehicles, electric bicycles, and shared EVs  
- **Electric aerial transport:**  
  - Drone or small helicopter for emergency, transport, or delivery purposes  
  - Must run on electricity only, with dedicated charging stations  
  - Integration with habitat’s microgrid for sustainable energy supply  
- **Non-applicable:** Large-scale vehicle drop-offs, extensive guest parking

### 3.4 Communication & Connectivity  
- **High-speed internet via satellite dish.**  
- **Requirement:** Constant connectivity for global collaboration.

### 3.5 Automation & Control  
- **Robotic systems**: farming, maintenance, food preparation.  
- **Central AI**: monitors critical systems (food, water, air, health).  
- **Requirement:** All *Maslow’s base needs* must be automated.  
- **Open Issue:** Human oversight vs. AI autonomy balance. 

### 3.6 Water Management  
- **Closed-loop recycling system**.  
- **Greywater treatment** → irrigation and reuse.  
- **Blackwater treatment** → biodigester for energy + fertilizer.  
- **Potable water reservoir** fed by filtration.  
- **Requirement:** 100% independence from outside water sources.  
- **Open Issue:** Potable water purification technology needs selection/testing.  

### 3.7 Waste Management  
- **Organic waste → biodigester → energy + fertilizer.**  
- **Non-organic waste → recycled/reused within habitat.**  
- **Requirement:** Zero external waste discharge.  
- **Open Issue:** Protocol for hazardous waste handling (medical/electronic), the tEcohabitat-One will not have capacity to process non-organic waste

### 3.8 Food Production  
- **Vertical Farming Towers** (Sky Greens–style, 10x yield per land area).  
- **Greenhouses** for controlled seasonal production.  
- **Horizontal Farming** for crops unsuitable for vertical systems (grains, legumes).  
- **Requirement:** Must ensure **100% vegetarian, diverse, healthy diet**.  
- **Open Issue:** Exact nutritional requirements per person/day need validation.  



 

### 3.6 Architecture & Layout  
- **Structure on posts**: wildlife moves freely below.  
- **Minimal land footprint.**  
- **Social spaces protected from weather instability.**  
- **Requirement:** Design to optimize energy use, comfort, and resilience.  
- **Open Issue:** Final architectural form determined collaboratively.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements  

- **Safety:** Redundant systems for energy, water, air.  
- **Scalability:** Design must be modular and replicable.  
- **Resilience:** Must withstand environmental extremes.  
- **Sustainability:** Net-zero ecological impact.  
- **Usability:** Residents interact seamlessly with automated systems.

## 5. Phased Development  

1. **Concept Design** – Model + community discussions.  
2. **Virtual Simulation** – Testing of systems and interactions.  
3. **Prototype Design** – Engineering plan of a physical structure.  
4. **Physical Prototype** – First small-scale habitat.  
5. **Scaling & Replication** – Automated reproduction of habitats worldwide.

## 6. Open Questions & Unknowns  

- Nutritional diversity: Can vertical farming + greenhouse supply 100%?  
- Energy storage: Which technology ensures full autonomy?  
- Waste hazards: How to handle medical/e-waste safely in closed loop?  
- AI governance: What level of decision-making should AI hold?  
- Cost estimation: What resources are required for prototype phase?  
- Long-term resilience: How does the habitat adapt to climate extremes?

## 7. Conclusion  

tEcoHabitat is not just a building — it is a **living system**. This requirements specification sets the foundation, while recognizing that many aspects must be **collaboratively refined** with experts, volunteers, and innovators. The ultimate goal is to design **a blueprint for future living** that protects both humanity and nature.
